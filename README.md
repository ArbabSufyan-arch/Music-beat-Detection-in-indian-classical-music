# Music-beat-Detection-in-indian-classical-music
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust and accurate algorithm for detecting beats in Indian classical music. Indian classical music has unique rhythmic structures and tempo variations, making beat detection a challenging task. The proposed system will leverage advanced signal processing techniques to extract relevant features from the audio signal and accurately identify the underlying beat pattern.

Project Objectives
Accurate Beat Detection: Develop an algorithm that can reliably detect beats in a variety of Indian classical music genres and styles.
Robustness: Ensure the system is robust to noise, variations in tempo, and other challenges commonly encountered in real-world audio data.
Efficiency: Design a computationally efficient algorithm that can process audio data in real-time or near real-time.
Versatility: Make the system adaptable to different Indian classical music traditions and instruments.
Technical Approach
Audio Preprocessing:
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the audio signal, such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP), and Spectral Centroid.
Normalization: Normalize the extracted features to ensure consistent input to the algorithm.
Beat Detection Algorithm:
Tempo Estimation: Estimate the approximate tempo of the music using techniques like autocorrelation or Fourier analysis.
Beat Pattern Detection: Employ machine learning or statistical models to identify the underlying beat pattern based on the extracted features and estimated tempo.
Beat Onset Detection: Determine the precise timing of each beat using techniques like onset detection functions (ODFs).
Evaluation and Refinement:
Dataset: Use a curated dataset of Indian classical music recordings with annotated beat information for training and evaluation.
Metrics: Evaluate the performance of the algorithm using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Refinement: Iterate on the algorithm and experiment with different feature extraction techniques, machine learning models, and parameter settings to improve performance.
