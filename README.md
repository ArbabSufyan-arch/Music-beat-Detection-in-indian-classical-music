# Music-beat-Detection-in-indian-classical-music
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a model for detecting beats in Indian classical music. Indian classical music has unique rhythmic structures and tempo variations, making beat detection a challenging task. The proposed system will leverage advanced signal processing techniques to extract relevant features from the audio signal and accurately identify the underlying beat pattern.
## Technical Approach
### Audio Preprocessing:
#### Feature Extraction: 
Extract relevant features from the audio signal, such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP), and Spectral Centroid.
#### Link to signal processed files: 
you can access the files here.

### Deep learning Model:
#### Long short Time Model: 
LSTM recurrent network  is used for as a training.
### Evaluation and Refinement:
#### Dataset: Used dataset of Indian classical musics. The dataset were collected some by sites and some from youtubes.
#### Metrics: Evaluate the performance of the algorithm using metrics by accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
